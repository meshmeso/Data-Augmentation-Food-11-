# Data-Augmentation-Food-11-
In this study, we explored the impact of data augmentation on food image classification using three convolutional neural network architectures: ResNet34, VGG16, and AlexNet. We applied various augmentation techniques to enhance the training dataset and evaluated the performance of each model.
